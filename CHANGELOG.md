# Changelog

## v0.4.0 (2026-06-07)

- **Context factory**: Context factor for injection of custom-made context classes

## v0.3.0 (2026-04-19)

### Bug fixes

- **Fixed critical caching bug**: `manifest.json` is now only written on successful task completion, ensuring that failed tasks can be safely retried.
- **Dedicated error state**: Added a new `error.json` marker file written upon task failure, capturing the error message, traceback, and a `partial_manifest` of files written prior to failure.

## v0.2.0 (2026-04-07)

### Breaking changes

- Renamed "workflow" to "task" across the entire codebase (`Workflow` -> `Task`, `@register_workflow` -> `@register_task`, etc.).
- Removed `TaskContextProtocol`. Use `TaskContext` directly instead.
- **Caching moved to execution time**: `Pipeline.build_plan()` no longer accepts an `is_cached` callback. Cache detection now happens automatically inside `execute_task()` — if `manifest.json` already exists at the task's storage prefix, the task is skipped without re-running. Remove any `is_cached=...` arguments from `build_plan()` calls and any `LocalStorageBackend.make_cache_checker()` / `is_result_cached()` usage.
- `TaskNode.cached` field removed. Tasks are no longer pre-marked cached at plan-build time.
- `run_plan_locally()` no longer accepts a `use_cache` parameter. Caching is always active and requires no configuration.
- `LocalStorageBackend.make_cache_checker()` and `LocalStorageBackend.is_result_cached()` removed.
- `ExecutionResult` gains a new `cached: bool` field (default `False`) indicating whether the task was skipped due to an existing result.
- `ExecutionResult.files_written` removed. Tasks communicate results exclusively through file writes to the storage context.
- **`submit_plan()` now returns `PlanHandle`** instead of a raw `str`. Update any code that stores or inspects the return value directly.
- `on_node_start`, `on_node_complete`, and `on_node_failure` removed from the `ExecutionBackend` protocol. They remain as keyword-only parameters on `LocalBackend.submit_plan()` for testing and CLI use.
- `CompletionCallback.notify()` signature changed from `(analysis_id: int, result: ExecutionResult)` to `(plan_id: str, success: bool, error: Optional[str])`. Update any custom callback implementations.

### New features

- **`save_text` / `read_text`**: `StorageBackend`, `LocalStorageBackend`, `S3StorageBackend`, and `TaskContext` now expose `save_text(filename, data, encoding="utf-8")` for writing plain-text files, complementing the existing `save_file` (bytes), `save_json`, and `save_xarray`. `TaskContext` also adds `read_text(filename, encoding="utf-8")` as a convenience wrapper. This closes the gap with `OutputFile(file_type="text")`, which had no corresponding write method.
- **`open_file` write-mode guard**: `open_file` is read-only by design. Both `LocalStorageBackend` and `S3StorageBackend` now raise `ValueError` if a write mode (`w`, `a`, or `x`) is passed. Previously `LocalStorageBackend` silently opened the file for writing while bypassing write-once semantics, `allowed_outputs` checks, and manifest tracking; `S3StorageBackend` silently discarded the write and returned a read buffer instead.
- **`PlanHandle`**: serializable reference to a submitted plan execution. Call `handle.to_json()` to store it (e.g. in a Django model field) and `PlanHandle.from_json(s)` to restore it later. Methods:
  - `get_state() -> str` — `"pending"` | `"running"` | `"success"` | `"failure"`. For Celery hits Redis; for Step Functions calls `describe_execution`; never queries S3.
  - `get_progress() -> PlanProgress` — per-node completion based on `manifest.json` presence.
  - `cancel()` — revokes the Celery chord or stops the Step Functions execution.
  - `configure_celery(app)` — class-level method; call once at startup so `get_state()` / `cancel()` work outside the `CeleryBackend` instance.
- **`PlanProgress`**: returned by `PlanHandle.get_progress()`. Fields: `total`, `completed`, `node_breakdown: dict[str, bool]`. Properties: `fraction` (0.0–1.0), `is_complete`.
- **`ProgressChecker` protocol** (`muflow.storage`): storage-layer abstraction for checking node completion across multiple prefixes without querying an execution backend.
  - `LocalProgressChecker`: checks `os.path.exists(prefix/manifest.json)`.
  - `S3ProgressChecker(bucket)`: one `HEAD` request per prefix (10–50 ms each within the same AWS region).
  - `make_progress_checker(storage_type, storage_config)`: factory that reconstructs the right implementation from serialized config; extend by adding a new class and one branch here.
- **`CeleryCompletionCallback` wired into `CeleryBackend`**: pass `completion_callback=CeleryCompletionCallback(app, "myapp.tasks.on_complete")` to `submit_plan()` and a `muflow.send_completion` Celery task fires after the plan finishes, calling your task with `(plan_id, success, error)`. The `muflow.send_completion` task is registered automatically by `create_celery_task()`.

## v0.1.0 (2026-04-04)

Initial release.

### Features
